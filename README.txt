 * Parser for MARC records

 * MARC package, originally called "php-marc", that is part of the Emilda 
 * Project (http://www.emilda.org). Both projects were released under the LGPL
 * which allowed me to port the project to C# for use with the .NET Framework.

2011-02-16 Changes:

Added personal email to copyright notices.
Updated copyright years
Added an overloaded GetSubfields() so you no longer have to pass in null to get all subfields.
Changed Warnings from protected to public. No idea what I was thinking there.
Tons more error checking in the FileMARC decode function due to coming across an egregiously bad record.
Now with fancy new Demo application! Hopefully it has enough example code to get people started better.
Updated solution files to VS2010
Probably some other stuff.
