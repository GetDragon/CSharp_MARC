/**
 * Editor for MARC records
 *
 * This project is built upon the CSharp_MARC project of the same name available
 * at http://csharpmarc.net, which itself is based on the File_MARC package
 * (http://pear.php.net/package/File_MARC) by Dan Scott, which was based on PHP
 * MARC package, originally called "php-marc", that is part of the Emilda
 * Project (http://www.emilda.org). Both projects were released under the LGPL
 * which allowed me to port the project to C# for use with the .NET Framework.
